Hello, I'm a full-stack software engineer who just moved to the San Francisco Bay area. I spent 4 years previously working for a company called [NGP VAN](https://www.ngpvan.com/ "https://www.ngpvan.com/"), which provides a CRM for progressive political campaigns and socially-conscious organizations. Before that, I worked 8 years as a systems administrator in the United States Senate. Born and raised in New York City, but am now happily enjoying the warmer climate of the west coast.
